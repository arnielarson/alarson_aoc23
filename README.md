# Advent of Code

AOC coding competition happens each December, 25 problems, with a Christmas (elf, etc) theme.

## Why

I tried these problems in 2023 and was immediately kind of hooked.  Tried every problem.

I also spent a bit of time in 2024 but did not have enough bandwidth to actually try to solve the problems in real time.  I did however try a bunch at the end of December and continued to learn a few things.
