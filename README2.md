## AoC 2024

Started these problems, but life did not allow for sufficient time to make as much progress as I'd have liked.

Adding these all to the AoC repo and creating a venv setup.

## Use a virtual environment

% python -m venv .venv

% source .venv/bin/activate

% pip install -r requirements.txt

## Problem learnings?

Reminding how to use combinations and permutations in itertools.  Duh.
